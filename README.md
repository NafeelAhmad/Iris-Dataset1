# Iris-Dataset1

Steps Applied:
1. First load the iris dataset from sklearn.datasets
2. check feature_names and target_names and iris.data
3. Add one new column named as 'Flower_name' and set the flower name as setosa, virginica, versicolor for data visaulisation.
4. Using Matplot plot graph between sepal length of setosa and versicolor and plot graph of petal length also.
5. Dropping two column 'target' & 'flower_name' and set as X, y = df.target
6. Splitting dataset using train_test_split with size of 0.20
7. Fit the data and apply svm model
8. And last tuning the parameter to get the accuracy.
